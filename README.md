### Baltimore City Police 911 Calls 2024: Mapped Arrest Locations for Weapons Incidents

This is a personal project mapping 2024 weapons-related incidents in the city. The data are from [https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/5d378673c8f4427fb9d02de362d5b634_0/explore?location=-0.000000%2C0.000000%2C1.01](https://data.baltimorecity.gov/datasets/5d378673c8f4427fb9d02de362d5b634_0/explore?location=-0.000000%2C0.000000%2C1.01)
